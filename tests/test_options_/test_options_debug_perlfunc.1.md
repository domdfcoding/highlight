The functions in this section can serve as terms in an expression.
They fall into two major categories: list operators and named unary
operators.  These differ in their precedence relationship with a
following comma.  (See the precedence table in perlop.)  List
operators take more than one argument, while unary operators can never
take more than one argument.  Thus, a comma terminates the argument of
a unary operator, but merely separates the arguments of a list
operator.  A unary operator generally provides a scalar context to its
argument, while a list operator may provide either scalar or list
contexts for its arguments.  If it does both, the scalar arguments will
be first, and the list argument will follow.  (Note that there can ever
be only one such list argument.)  For instance, [33m\fI[39;49;00msplice()[33m\fR[39;49;00m has three scalar
arguments followed by a list, whereas [33m\fI[39;49;00mgethostbyname()[33m\fR[39;49;00m has four scalar
arguments.
.[34mPP[39;49;00m
In the syntax descriptions that follow, list operators that expect a
list (and provide list context for the elements of the list) are shown
with [33m\s[39;49;00m-1LIST[33m\s[39;49;00m0 as an argument.  Such a list may consist of any combination
of scalar arguments or list values; the list values will be included
in the list as if each individual element were interpolated at that
point in the list, forming a longer single-dimensional list value.
Commas should separate elements of the [33m\s[39;49;00m-1LIST[33m\s[39;49;00m0.
.[34mPP[39;49;00m
Any function in the list below may be used either with or without
parentheses around its arguments.  (The syntax descriptions omit the
parentheses.)  If you use the parentheses, the simple (but occasionally
surprising) rule is this: It [33m\fI[39;49;00mlooks[33m\fR[39;49;00m like a function, therefore it [33m\fI[39;49;00mis[33m\fR[39;49;00m a
function, and precedence doesn't matter.  Otherwise it's a list
operator or unary operator, and precedence does matter.  And whitespace
between the function and left parenthesis doesn't count[33m\*[39;49;00m(--so you need to
be careful sometimes:

For functions that can be used in either a scalar or list context,
nonabortive failure is generally indicated in a scalar context by
returning the undefined value, and in a list context by returning the
null list.

Remember the following important rule: There is [33m\fB[39;49;00mno rule[33m\fR[39;49;00m that relates
the behavior of an expression in list context to its behavior in scalar
context, or vice versa.  It might do two totally different things.
Each operator and function decides which sort of value it would be most
appropriate to return in scalar context.  Some operators return the
length of the list that would have been returned in list context.  Some
operators return the first value in the list.  Some operators return the
last value in the list.  Some operators return a count of successful
operations.  In general, they do what you want, unless you want
consistency.

A named array in scalar context is quite different from what would at
first glance appear to be a list in scalar context.  You can't get a list
like [33m\f[39;49;00m(CW[33m\*[39;49;00m(C`(1,2,3)[33m\*[39;49;00m(C'[33m\fR[39;49;00m into being in scalar context, because the compiler knows
the context at compile time.  It would generate the scalar comma operator
there, not the list construction version of the comma.  That means it
was never a list to start with.

A file test, where X is one of the letters listed below.  This unary
operator takes one argument, either a filename or a filehandle, and
tests the associated file to see if something is true about it.  If the
argument is omitted, tests [33m\f[39;49;00m(CW$_[33m\fR[39;49;00m, except for [33m\f[39;49;00m(CW[33m\*[39;49;00m(C`[33m\-[39;49;00mt[33m\*[39;49;00m(C'[33m\fR[39;49;00m, which tests [33m\s[39;49;00m-1STDIN[33m\s[39;49;00m0.
Unless otherwise documented, it returns [33m\f[39;49;00m(CW1[33m\fR[39;49;00m for true and [33m\f[39;49;00m(CW''[33m\fR[39;49;00m for false, or
the undefined value if the file doesn't exist.  Despite the funny
names, precedence is the same as any other named unary operator, and
the argument may be parenthesized like any other unary operator.  The

On systems that support fchmod, you might pass file handles among the
files.  On systems that don't support fchmod, passing file handles
produces a fatal error at run time.

remove the newline from the end of an input record when you're worried
